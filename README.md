Crud Project for Ekreative by YeisonHunt

Tech Stack

- Lambda
- Typescript
- S3
- Serverless framework
- AWS CLI

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured (extract on CSV the credentials, we will need them to store on secrets or src/secret.ts as defaults)
- The credentials for AWS CLI should have S3 Access, Cloudformation and other permissions.
- Advice: previous credentials with full access then after test the code, delete them.
- [`serverless-framework`](https://github.com/serverless/serverless)
- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org)

## Installation

Run:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```
yarn install
```

## Testing

npm run test
```

## Deployment

## Endpoints structure

- GET /product/{uuid} - gets a product by UUID
- PUT /product/{uuid} - updates a product by UUID
